            HTML Horizontal Rules

        <p>
            The &lt;hr&gt; tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a 
            horizontal rule.
            <br>The &lt;hr&gt; element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

        </p>

        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
    </body>
