        <h1>The Lang Attribute</h1>
        <p>You should always include the lang attribute inside the &lt;html&gt; tag, 
            to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and 
            browsers.<br><br>
            The following example specifies English as the language:
        </p>
        <img src="14.png">
        <p>
            Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. 
            So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two 
            characters define the country.
            <br><br>
            The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
        </p>
